Hi, I'm LordWorms, a developer specializing in distributed systems with a focus on query engines. With a passion for building scalable and efficient systems, I actively contribute to [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion) and related projects.

Currently, I'm working at Google, focusing on vector search infrastructure, building systems that push the boundaries of retrieval performance and scalability.
