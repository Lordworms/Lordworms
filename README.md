Hi, I'm LordWorms, a developer specializing in distributed systems with a focus on query engines. With a passion for building scalable and efficient systems, I actively contribute to [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion) and related projects.

### I am still searching for the meaning of life in my confused 20s.
